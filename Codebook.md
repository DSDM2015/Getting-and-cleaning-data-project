# Codebook<h1> 
The file tidy_data_means.txt contains the mean values for 66 measurements across 30 subjects and 6 activity levels. 
It was compiled using run_analysis.R, which contains detailed comments. On overview is also given by README.md

The measurement were performed using different instruments (Accelerometer, Gyroscope) and angels (XYZ). Values include both mean values and standard deviations in the original data file, which have been aggregated by subject and activity level (mean values). The variable names reflect these different ways of measurement.
Some values were transformed (Fast Fourier Transformed), which are denoted by the term "Frequency" in the variable name.
